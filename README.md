# Webscraping Project using BeautifulSoup

I wrote a simple scraper using Beatifulsoup that extracts and filters out Python job [posts](https://www.timesjobs.com/candidate/job-search.html?from=submit&actualTxtKeywords=python&searchBy=0&rdoOperator=OR&searchType=personalizedSearch&luceneResultSize=25&postWeek=60&txtKeywords=python&pDate=I&sequence=1&startPage=1) per page based on an inputted skill by user. Each job post details are saved on a .txt file
